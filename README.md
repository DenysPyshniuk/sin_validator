# sin_validator
SIN validator is created in order user to find out if their face SIN is passing rules like:
1) It is 9 digits long
2) Every 2nd digit in the SIN should be multiplied by 2.
3) If multiply digit over 9 the digit should be seperated its individual values when added up like 8*2=16 => 1 + 6.
4) Then add all the numbers, the sum should be divisible by 10.
